> A full-fledged web app built using ReactJS, Bootstrap and other TPLs to provide relief in times of sea-level rise and coastal flooding

## Motive
Being a low-lying country, certain parts of India are very much prone to coastal floods as the sea-level rises. For the scope of this project, we selected Mumbai because of its high population density and frequently flooded coasts. Data is gathered from GIS to provide a vulnerability map too along with a chatbot powered by OpenAI.

## Features:

### 3D models with AR interactivity:
Google's model-viewer was used to integrate 3D models in GLB format and add a "View in AR" option when the site is opened in mobile devices.

### Interactive stories:
A modal component renders a video which, upon ending, provides the user with choices to decide the next outcome. State Management and Bootstrap modals were used for it.

### Immersive Home Screen:
An immersive home screen with custom fonts and navigation scroll helps user smoothly navigate through the entire web-app. Routing is also used for some of the features.

### 24*7 Active Chatbot powered by OpenAI:
A chatbot using the openAI API and front end widget was made to help user with queries. NOTE: Generation of response can sometime take a while because the call is made to openAI API to fetch the response.

### Am I Safe and Vulnerability Map
Using Leaflet, maps were integrated to show and stimulate what areas are vulnerable and safe incase of a flood event in Mumbai. User can simulate a sea-level rise(example 1mm/2mm) and check what areas might get flooded.

#### Additional:
The project has much more to it. Users can collab and share pics of Flood which get stored in Firebase, get flood SMS alerts using Twilio, Subscribe themselves to receive alerts and more. Get in touch to understand the complete scope of this project. Thanks :)
